Categories are a loosely defined, controlled vocabulary defined by the curators,
and there will be only one or two (or maybe, three) assigned to each 'Source'.
Each instance of a Category that is assigned to a Source is called a Categorization.

The two axiis for categories are 1) Topic and 2) Level of Government. For example,
"Environment" and "Crime" can be categories, and so are "Federal" and "Washington DC".

Categories are meant to be hierarchical. For example, there can be a "Economy" category
with "Labor" underneath it as a sub-category. The "Browse" feature of the site will rely heavily on categories.
