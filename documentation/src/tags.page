Tags are open-ended, uncontrolled, user-defined labels on sources.

Similar to Delicious.com, any user can add a Tag to a Source. 
Tags are not hierarchical, and there can be many tags assigned to each Source.
They are intended as a social feature, that users can use to group sources in
ways that make sense to them.
